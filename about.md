Hi, my name is Kanen Stephens, and I'm a student, developer, artist, Christian, creator, and all around person living in Huntsville, Alabama ðŸš€

- big fan of nature
- deep thinker, existentialist
- artsy and creative
- high fantasy and anime fan
- hoping to make the world a better place
- i honestly don't know how to sum myself up with bullet points

> Find me on Github @ [github.com/kanennn](htttps://github.com/kanennn)!

## If you're here to hire me...
- I'm a self taught developer, and have been a hobbyist in software and hardware since 2018
- I work primarily in Go, Java, and Python, have some experience with C#, HTMl+CSS, and am personally familiar with platforms like Linux *(cli/bash)* and Git/GitHub
- The majority of my software experience and education has been personal, which means I don't have as many bases covered as a typical college graduate, however I have developed very strong problem solving skills and critical thinking working by myself for many years
- As a very curious person in general, I am very apt to learn new skills and have a strong passion for software and hardware development
- In addition to continuing to learn on my own, I am also enrolled at the University of Alabama in Huntsville to study Computer Engineering to further develop my expertise

## if you'd just like to get to know me...
- hi, most people know me online *(and in person lol)* as **kanennn**
- i'm honestly very odd, a little insane, autistic, very creative and always having a great time (or trying to pretend to )
- if you know of me in person, just say hi! i'm not a super extroverted person, so i may not want to be your friend, but i'd love to meet you and talk :)
- if you've come from the whimsical world of the interwebs, then feel free to check me out at [kanennn.net](https://kanennn.net), where you can find more of my general internet presence and socials to follow me or reach out if you'd like!
