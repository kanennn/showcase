  <li>artsy and creative</li>
  <li>high fantasy and anime fan</li>
  <li>hoping to make the world a better place</li>
  <li>i honestly donâ€™t know how to sum myself up with bullet points</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="if-youre-here-to-hire-me">If youâ€™re here to hire meâ€¦</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™m a self taught developer, and have been a hobbyist in software and hardware since 2018</li>
  <li>I work primarily in Go, Java, and Python, have some experience with C#, HTMl+CSS, and am personally familiar with platforms like Linux <em>(cli/bash)</em> and Git/GitHub</li>
  <li>The majority of my software experience and education has been personal, which means I donâ€™t have as many bases covered as a typical college graduate, however I have developed very strong problem solving skills and critical thinking working by myself for many years</li>
  <li>As a very curious person in general, I am very apt to learn new skills and have a strong passion for software and hardware development</li>
  <li>In addition to continuing to learn on my own, I am also enrolled at the University of Alabama in Huntsville to study Computer Engineering to further develop my expertise</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="if-youd-just-like-to-get-to-know-me">if youâ€™d just like to get to know meâ€¦</h2>
<ul>
  <li>hi, most people know me online <em>(and in person lol)</em> as <strong>kanennn</strong></li>
  <li>iâ€™m honestly very odd, a little insane, autistic, very creative and always having a great time (or trying to pretend to )</li>
  <li>if you know of me in person, just say hi! iâ€™m not a super extroverted person, so i may not want to be your friend, but iâ€™d love to meet you and talk :)</li>
  <li>if youâ€™ve come from the whimsical world of the interwebs, then feel free to check me out at <a href="https://kanennn.net">kanennn.net</a>, where you can find more of my general internet presence and socials to follow me or reach out if youâ€™d like!</li>
